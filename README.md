# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Course

This repo contains my work for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Course on Udacity.  Each course will be partitioned into separate directories.  The exception for this is the first course where it was considered optional.  Specifically, it was to release a Python package to PyPI.  I used the same methods provided in the course and released my work on vanishing point detection to PyPI.  Though it is not available in this repo, you can visit this work here: https://github.com/rayryeng/XiaohuLuVPDetection.

Please note that the code provided is designed to run on Amazon SageMaker.  However, at a minimum you will need Python 3.6, PyTorch 0.4.0 and MXNet.

## SageMaker Deployment Project - Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this project was to work with the IMDB movie review dataset and create a predictive model that can predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.  The instructions for completion and deployment can be found in `sentiment_analysis_model`.  The notebook file found in this directory is the overall assignment, with directions to modify the necessary files to complete the task.
